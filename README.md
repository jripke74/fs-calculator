# fs-calculator

In this workshop, you will review your knowledge of functions by building a calculator.

Step 1
In this workshop, you will review how to work with functions by building a calculator app.

In the previous lecture videos, you learned how to declare functions like this:

Example Code
// regular function
function myFunction() {

}

// arrow function
const myArrowFunction = () => {

}
Start by creating a function called addTwoAndSeven.

You can choose to use the regular function syntax or the arrow function syntax.

Step 2
One of concepts you learned in the previous lecture videos was how to return values from a function.

Here is a reminder of how to return a value from a function:

Example Code
function myFunction() {
  return "Hello World";
}
Inside your addTwoAndSeven function, return the sum of 2 and 7.

Step 3 Passed
In the previous lecture videos, you learned how to call (invoke) a function. Calling a function means to execute the code inside the function.

Here is a reminder of how to call a function:

Example Code
function myFunction() {
  return "Hello World";
}

// function call
myFunction();
Add a console.log statement, and inside it, call the addTwoAndSeven function.

You should now see the sum of 2 and 7 logged to the console.
